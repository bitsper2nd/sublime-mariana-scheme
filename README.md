# Color Scheme - Mariana Plus

This is a Sublime Text (and Merge) color scheme using the [Mariana color palette](https://github.com/n0rmand0/Mariana-Pro-color-theme).

## Install

Git clone the project or download the project to your Sublime Text or Sublime Merge Packages folder as
`Mariana Color Scheme`. If you want to use it in both Sublime Merge and Sublime Text, you only have to install it in
Sublime Text as Sublime Merge will find the color schemes in Sublime Text.

For Sublime Text, edit your `Preferences.sublime-settings` file to use the Monokai theme:

```
    "color_scheme": "Packages/Mariana Color Scheme/Mariana Plus (Cool).sublime-color-scheme",
```
